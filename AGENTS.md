# Agent Guide: scratch-editor

## AI-assisted development policy

See [CONTRIBUTING.AI.md](https://github.com/scratchfoundation/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.AI.md) for Scratch's
org-wide policy on AI-assisted contributions. The short version: human developers remain responsible for all code
they submit. Do not submit code you cannot explain and defend in a review.

## Agent defaults

Use these defaults unless the user asks otherwise:

1. Keep changes minimal and scoped to the user request. Do not refactor surrounding code, add features, or clean up
   style in areas you weren't asked to touch.
2. Do not preserve backward compatibility when it isn't required. When all callers are internal to a package,
   rename or restructure freely. All packages in this repo are published to npm and consumed externally, so treat
   each package's public exports as a contract and preserve compatibility unless explicitly told otherwise.
3. Write comments that explain the current code, not its history. Do not reference prior implementations,
   intermediate states, or what the code "used to do." If an approach seems counterintuitive, explain why it is
   correct now — not why it changed.
4. Prefer fixing root causes over adding surface-level workarounds or assertions.
5. When fixing a bug, start by adding one or more failing tests that reproduce it, then implement the fix. Iterate
   until all tests pass, including but not limited to the new tests. Use the test framework already in use in that
   package — see "Packages at a glance" below.
6. When adding runtime guards for states that should never happen, log actionable context (function name, relevant
   IDs, key flags) rather than failing silently. Use `console.warn` for recoverable states and `console.error` for
   invalid required data.
7. Preserve failure semantics when refactoring. An implicit crash (null dereference, `!` assertion) should become
   an explicit `throw` with a useful message — not silent failure. Code that previously wouldn't crash still
   shouldn't, but consider whether a warning is warranted. Replacing a potential null dereference with
   `if (!foo) return` could make a bug harder to find; `if (!foo) throw new Error(...)` surfaces it.
8. Do not add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that cannot happen. Trust internal code and
   framework guarantees. Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs).

## What this repository is

`scratch-editor` is an npm workspaces monorepo containing the packages that make up the Scratch editor. It was
assembled by migrating previously separate repositories into a single repo.

All packages are published to npm under the `@scratch/` scope. They are consumed both internally (e.g.,
`scratch-www` loads `scratch-gui`) and by third parties.

## Build and lint

Run workspace-wide commands from the repo root:

```sh
npm run build    # Build all packages (production)
npm test         # Test all packages
npm run clean    # Clean all packages
```

Run per-package commands from the package directory, or from the root with `--workspace`:

```sh
cd packages/scratch-vm && npm test
# or equivalently:
npm test --workspace=packages/scratch-vm
```

Each package defines its own `test` and `build` scripts; see "Packages at a glance" for specifics.

**Commit messages are enforced.** Husky + commitlint validate every commit against the
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format. A commit that doesn't conform will be
rejected by the pre-commit hook.

## Packages at a glance

| Package | Language | Bundler | Tests |
| - | - | - | - |
| `scratch-gui` | JavaScript / JSX (some TypeScript) | webpack | Jest |
| `scratch-vm` | JavaScript | webpack | Tap |
| `scratch-render` | JavaScript | webpack | Tap |
| `scratch-svg-renderer` | JavaScript | webpack | Tap |
| `task-herder` | TypeScript | Vite | Vitest |
| `scratch-media-lib-scripts` | JavaScript | — | Jest |

`task-herder` represents the target stack for new packages (TypeScript + Vite + Vitest). The other packages
reflect the legacy stack and are being migrated incrementally.

## Technology conventions by package

**For existing packages**: follow the conventions already in use in that package — language, bundler, test
framework, and style. Do not introduce TypeScript into a JavaScript package, or Vitest into a Jest package,
unless that migration is the explicit goal of the task.

**For new packages**: follow the org defaults — TypeScript, Vite, Vitest, `eslint-config-scratch`.

All packages use ESLint 9 flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`) with `eslint-config-scratch`. If a package also uses
Prettier (currently `task-herder`), run `npm run format` in addition to lint.

### scratch-gui specifics

- React functional components with hooks for new code; class components exist in older code.
- Keep components presentational where possible; connect to Redux only in container files.
- Use `react-intl` / `FormattedMessage` for all user-visible strings. Do not hardcode English in JSX.
- After adding or changing messages, run `npm run i18n:src` to update the translation source file.
- Integration tests (`test/integration/`) require a browser environment via Jest + jsdom; they are slow and
  should not be run unnecessarily. Smoke tests (`test/smoke/`) require a live server.

### scratch-vm specifics

- Extension entry points live in `src/extensions/`. Each extension exports a class with `getInfo()` and block
  implementation methods.
- i18n strings in extensions are extracted with `format-message`. Run `npm run i18n:src` after changing them.

## Python coding standards

Follow these standards for any Python code added to the repository. If a Python project in the repository provides
more specific configuration in `pyproject.toml`, its local configuration takes precedence.

### Style and design

- Target the Python version declared by the project and follow PEP 8 naming, layout, and import conventions. Use
  Ruff for formatting and linting when introducing Python tooling to a project that does not already have a
  formatter or linter.
- Add type annotations to public functions, methods, and module-level data. Prefer precise built-in collection
  types and avoid `Any` unless data genuinely crosses an untyped boundary. Type-check new Python projects with
  mypy or Pyright and keep the selected configuration in `pyproject.toml`.
- Prefer small, focused functions and modules with explicit inputs and return values. Use classes only when state or
  a clear domain abstraction requires them; use dataclasses for value-like records.
- Use `pathlib.Path` for filesystem paths, context managers for resources, and standard-library functionality
  instead of adding dependencies for simple tasks.
- Catch only exceptions that can be handled meaningfully. Never use a bare `except`, silently discard an error, or
  use exceptions for ordinary control flow. Preserve the original exception when adding context with `raise ...
  from ...`.
- Validate untrusted data at system boundaries. Do not duplicate validation between internal functions, and do not
  add fallback behavior for states guaranteed by the caller.
- Write docstrings for public modules, classes, functions, and methods when their purpose, inputs, output, or raised
  exceptions are not obvious from the signature. Comments should explain why a decision is necessary rather than
  restating the code.
- Keep imports at module scope and ordered as standard library, third-party, then local imports. Never wrap imports
  in `try`/`except` blocks to hide missing dependencies.
- Do not use mutable values as default arguments. Avoid module-level mutable state, hidden I/O, and nondeterministic
  behavior unless the feature specifically requires them.

### Python testing

- Use pytest for new Python projects unless an existing package already uses another test framework. Keep tests in
  a `tests/` directory and name files `test_<subject>.py` and test functions `test_<behavior>`.
- For a bug fix, first add a test that fails for the reported behavior, then implement the fix. For new
  functionality, test the public behavior, important boundary cases, invalid external input, and meaningful failure
  paths.
- Keep tests deterministic, independent, and order-insensitive. Do not use real network services, wall-clock delays,
  or shared writable state; use pytest fixtures, temporary paths, dependency injection, and targeted mocks at
  external boundaries.
- Prefer assertions on observable results and side effects over implementation details. Use parametrized tests for
  equivalent input cases, but keep separate tests when failures would represent distinct behaviors.
- Every test must prove a behavior that could regress. Avoid tests that merely execute code, duplicate another test,
  or mock the unit under test.
- Run the narrowest relevant test while iterating, then run the complete Python test suite, formatter check, linter,
  and type checker before submitting. Document exact project commands in `pyproject.toml`, the package README, or
  this file when Python tooling is introduced.
- Treat coverage as a way to find missing scenarios, not as a substitute for meaningful assertions. New and changed
  behavior should be covered even when the repository does not enforce a numeric coverage threshold.

## npm workflow

Use `npm ci` from the repo root to install all workspace dependencies from `package-lock.json`.

When adding or updating a dependency in a specific package:

```sh
npm install some-package@version --workspace=packages/scratch-vm
```

This updates both `package.json` in the target package and the root `package-lock.json`.

Keep each section of a package's `package.json` (`dependencies`, `devDependencies`, `scripts`) in alphabetical
order. The same applies to the root `package.json`.

**Do not publish packages manually.** Every package has a `prepublishOnly` script that will error if you try.
Publishing is handled exclusively by the CI release pipeline.

## Before submitting changes

Review all changes and confirm:

- **Scope**: Changes are confined to the user request; nothing extra was added or modified.
- **Correctness**: Logic is sound and edge cases were considered.
- **Comments**: Comments are necessary, short, and clear; self-explanatory code has none.
- **Simplicity**: Implementation is as simple as possible; no speculative abstractions remain.
- **Documentation**: Update `AGENTS.md` and any other documentation files whose content is affected by the change
  (commands, repo structure, conventions, etc.). The "Packages at a glance" table is particularly prone to going
  stale when a package migrates its tooling.
- **Commit format**: Commit message follows Conventional Commits — the husky hook will reject it otherwise.
- **Build passes**: `npm run build` (or `npm run build` in the affected package) completes successfully.
- **Tests pass**: `npm test` (or `npm test` in the affected package) completes with no failures.
- **No lint errors**: `npm run test:lint` (or `npm run lint`) passes in the affected package.
